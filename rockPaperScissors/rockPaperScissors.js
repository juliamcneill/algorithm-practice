/*
* Write a function that generates every sequence of throws a single

* Your output should look something like:
*   ["RRR",
*    "RRP",
*    "RRS",
*    "RPR",
*    ...etc...
*   ]
*
* Extra credit:
*   - Make your function return answers for any number of rounds.
*
* Example:
* rockPaperScissors(5); // => ['RRRRR', 'RRRRP', 'RRRRS', etc...]
